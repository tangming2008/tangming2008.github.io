As an undergrad, I learned some basic HTML and CSS and created a simple webpage in a class project. I haven't thought back then that I would have a fully functional personal website one day with all the modern features like social sharing, tagging, related posts and so on.

All this became possible thanks to [Michael Rose and his Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/about/) responsive [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme! I really loved the minimalistic design and the ability to customize a lot of features! The theme is also very well documented and has lots of examples. Using Markdown for writing HTML makes blogging a lot easier.

Another killer feature is that you can host your website on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) for free! 

No wonder that Minimal Mistakes is so popular. [It's GitHub](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) page was forked over 9000 times and starred over 5000 times! I personally got inspiration from these people who customized MM and also blogged about the process:
  - [Peter Willis](http://www.pwills.com)
  - [Aaron Young](https://web.eecs.utk.edu/~ayoung48/blog/#)
  - [Li Zeng](https://zenglix.github.io/)
  - [Jan Meppe](https://www.janmeppe.com/)
