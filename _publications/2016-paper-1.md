collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2016-paper-1
excerpt: 'With the aim to improve the surface wear resistance properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy as well as its biocompatibility as implants in human bodies, TiO2 particles are introduced to strengthen the properties of Ti-6Al-4V through the effect of friction stir processing. The effects of friction stir processing on the phase transformation and microstructure of TiO2-compounded Ti-6Al-4V are investigated systematically. Grain refinement in the stirring zone and phase transformation in the matrix material are observed and discussed in detail. The study provides a new insight on the desired properties of Ti-6Al-4V for biomedical applications using friction stir processing.'

With the aim to improve the surface wear resistance properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy as well as its biocompatibility as implants in human bodies, TiO2 particles are introduced to strengthen the properties of Ti-6Al-4V through the effect of friction stir processing. The effects of friction stir processing on the phase transformation and microstructure of TiO2-compounded Ti-6Al-4V are investigated systematically. Grain refinement in the stirring zone and phase transformation in the matrix material are observed and discussed in detail. The study provides a new insight on the desired properties of Ti-6Al-4V for biomedical applications using friction stir processing.
