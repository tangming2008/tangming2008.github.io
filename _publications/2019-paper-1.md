excerpt: 'In this work, a biomedical Ti-6Al-4V (TC4)/Zn composite with gradient microstructures was successfully prepared by friction stir processing (FSP). The microstructures and mechanical properties of the composite were systematically studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), atom probe tomography (APT), and microhardness test. The results show that TC4/Zn composite can be successfully prepared, and gradient microstructures varying from coarse grain to nanocrystalline is formed from the bottom to the upper surface. During FSP, adding Zn can accelerate the growth of β phase region, and the grain size significantly increases with the increasing rotation rate. The grain combination is the main mechanism for grain growth of β phase region. The deformation mechanisms gradually change from dislocation accumulations and rearrangement to dynamic recrystallization from the bottom to the upper surface (1.5 mm–150 μm from the upper surface). The composite exhibits slightly higher microhardness compared with the matrix. This paper provides a new method to obtain a TC4/Zn composite with gradient surface microstructures for potential applications in the biomedical field.'

In this work, a biomedical Ti-6Al-4V (TC4)/Zn composite with gradient microstructures was successfully prepared by friction stir processing (FSP). The microstructures and mechanical properties of the composite were systematically studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), atom probe tomography (APT), and microhardness test. The results show that TC4/Zn composite can be successfully prepared, and gradient microstructures varying from coarse grain to nanocrystalline is formed from the bottom to the upper surface. During FSP, adding Zn can accelerate the growth of β phase region, and the grain size significantly increases with the increasing rotation rate. The grain combination is the main mechanism for grain growth of β phase region. The deformation mechanisms gradually change from dislocation accumulations and rearrangement to dynamic recrystallization from the bottom to the upper surface (1.5 mm–150 μm from the upper surface). The composite exhibits slightly higher microhardness compared with the matrix. This paper provides a new method to obtain a TC4/Zn composite with gradient surface microstructures for potential applications in the biomedical field.
