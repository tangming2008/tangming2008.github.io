title: "A Review on Friction Stir Processing of Titanium Alloy: Characterization, Method, Microstructure, Properties"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-paper-3
excerpt: 'In the past two decades, friction stir processing (FSP) technology has received considerable attention. FSP can be used to adjust and control the microstructure of materials, including eliminating defects, destroying dendrites and controlling fractions in the second stage, and is therefore widely used in titanium and its alloys for biomedical, aerospace and automotive applications. This article comprehensively reviews the methods of studying FSP, the microstructure evolution of materials and the summary of material properties. It begins with the introduction of the FSW system, characterization, structure and elemental analysis, and simulation and performance testing methods, and then introduces the microstructure evolution mechanism of various titanium materials and discusses in detail the material properties of titanium alloy, namely hardness and wear resistance, elasticity and plasticity, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Finally, this review presents unresolved issues and outstanding challenges in FSP technology and reveals the direction of this emerging field of research.'

In the past two decades, friction stir processing (FSP) technology has received considerable attention. FSP can be used to adjust and control the microstructure of materials, including eliminating defects, destroying dendrites and controlling fractions in the second stage, and is therefore widely used in titanium and its alloys for biomedical, aerospace and automotive applications. This article comprehensively reviews the methods of studying FSP, the microstructure evolution of materials and the summary of material properties. It begins with the introduction of the FSW system, characterization, structure and elemental analysis, and simulation and performance testing methods, and then introduces the microstructure evolution mechanism of various titanium materials and discusses in detail the material properties of titanium alloy, namely hardness and wear resistance, elasticity and plasticity, corrosion resistance and biocompatibility. Finally, this review presents unresolved issues and outstanding challenges in FSP technology and reveals the direction of this emerging field of research.
