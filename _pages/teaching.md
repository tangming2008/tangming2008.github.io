I am a firm believer in **learning-by-teaching**.

Some key lessons that I learned over the past few years of working as a trainer in industry or teaching assistant in school:
* Use humor (BEST remedy to keep audience awake!)
* Use day life examples
* Ask questions and tell stories
* Limit jargon, acronym, and equations (I am a big fan of mathematical equations but a lot of people hate them ...)
