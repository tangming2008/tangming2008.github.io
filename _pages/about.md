  Hi, my nameâ€™s Zihao and I am a 3rd year Ph.D. Candidate in the [De Graef](https://neon.materials.cmu.edu/degraef/degraef.shtml) Group at Carnegie Mellon University.

  My research focuses on applying Machine Learning (ML) methods to Electron Backscatter Diffraction (EBSD) technique, including the indexing of orientation and deformation of materials. The objective is to realize faster, more accurate and more robust indexing than state-of-the-art method.

  Besides, I also contribute to the open source Dictionary Indexing (DI) software [EMsoft](https://github.com/EMsoft-org/EMsoft) developed by our group. Currently I'm mainly working on developing Python API for Dictionary Indexing methods, which involves cross-platform development (Fortran/C++/Python) and parallel computation (OpenCL/CUDA). You can check project repositories [PyEMEBSDDI_wrapper](https://github.com/Darkhunter9/PyEMEBSDDI_wrapper) and [PyEMEBSDDI](https://github.com/Darkhunter9/EMsoft/tree/develop/Source/EMsoftWrapperLib/DictionaryIndexing) for more details.

  Previously, before my Ph.D. program, I studied Friction Stir Processing (FSP) on titanium alloys (mainly as implants). The research focused on microstructure evolution, changes in mechanical properties and biocompatibility after surface modification was applied.

## A Little More About Me
