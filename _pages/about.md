I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at Northeastern University (Silicon Valley campus), graduating in May 2023. `Cross-validated` is my personal blog to keep track of my projects and different HOWTOs related to data and tech.

I’m passionate about Data Analytics and Data Science and recently discovered that I enjoy coding. Since Data Engineering is at the intersection of both Data Science and Software Engineering - both fields that I love - I decided to concentrate in Data Engineering.

I have strong programming skills in **Python** and currently learning **AWS, Spark, Hadoop and MapReduce**. I have solid understanding of Machine Learning and Databases (**Oracle, MongoDB, Redis**). My previous school [projects](/portfolio) also involved Node.js, Bootstrap, Java, C++.

Before enrolling to my Master’s program, I got a PhD in Political Science and worked as a Managing Editor for online analytical journal. During my previous career in academia, I developed strong [analytical, communication and management skills](/achievements/). I also have completed a number of [Data Science specializations online](/certificates).

I am the person who takes initiative and stays curious.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto: kbosko@cross-validated.com) if you find my blog useful, think I might be a good fit or simply would like to connect.
