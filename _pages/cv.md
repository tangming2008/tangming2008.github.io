Work experience ([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tangming1990/))
======

- Research engineer, ArcelorMittal Global R&D, 2018-03 - present
  - Managed the steel cleanliness characterization facility in support for product development, root cause analysis, and quality evaluation
  - Led projects on R&D fundamental steelmaking research to sustain new AHSS product manufacturability for the automotive customers, such as Tesla, Toyota, Nissan, and GM
  - Provided technical support to steelmaking operations to optimize the reliability of steelmaking process and minimize residual defects in the product
  - Co-chaired and organized the annual North America Innovation Awards (highest internal technical award)


- Research Assistant, Carnegie Mellon University, 2014-08 - 2017-05
  - Thesis: Inclusions, Porosity, and Fatigue of AlSi10Mg Parts Produced by Selective Laser Melting ([link](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/thesis/Inclusions_Porosity_and_Fatigue_of_AlSi10Mg_Parts_Produced_by_Selective_Laser_Melting/6720185))
  - Discovered the oxide-induced porosity as a novel type of defect which dominates the fatigue performance of additively manufactured aluminum alloy
  - Collaborated closely with researchers in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and industrial partners from Arconic on fatigue, tension, and compression tests

Skills
======
* Materials Science
  * Mechanical tests: fatigue, local formability tests (bendability, hole expansion), tension, nano-indentation
  * Characterization: Scanning electron microscope/SEM (highly skilled in automated-SEM analysis), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD),
* Data Science (in Python)
  * Classification: pandas, sklearn (LR, KNN, RF, etc), Keras/TensorFlow, GridSearchCV, xgb
